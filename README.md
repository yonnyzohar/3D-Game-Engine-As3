A clone of the c++ code by https://github.com/BuildSucceeded/3D-Game-Engine

This project started as a clone of the amazing tutorial series by "BuildSucceeded":
https://www.facebook.com/GameBuildSucceeded
In a series of 10 minute long videos he goes step by step on the production of a true CPU based 3d engine.
He makes complicated topics understandable and allows you to get your hands really dirty without passing on the heavy lifting to external
software like openGL.
If you've ever wanted to truly understand what goes on under the hood, this is the perfect resource.

It has since grown into something bigger. I am building on top of it to make my own 3d game, adding and tweaking the engine quite a bit.
